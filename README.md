## Features

* **On-Demand Reservation:** Reserve resources with ease using SCM Tenant integration.
* **Automated Deployments:** Seamlessly deploy key components (DC1, DC2, BR1, and BR2) in an automated, modular fashion.
* **Zero-Touch Configuration:** Automate the setup and configuration of Data Centers (DCs) and Branch Routers (BRs).
* **Tenant Management:** Easily configure and manage tenants to support diverse deployment needs.
* **Advanced Network Features:** Incorporate WAN emulation and application firewall configurations.
